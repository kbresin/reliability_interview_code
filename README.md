# reliability_interview_code

The goal of this interview is to test your experience and attention to deal when writing unit tests.

under ths src/ directory is a single file with a RandomUtils class with several functions, under test/ is a pytest file with a single assertion for one of the functions.

We would like you to add additional assertion statements as time allows.

There is a Class at the top of the random_utils.py file that is used by one of the functions. There is no need to write unit tests for that specific class.
